# This file implements the "noautomount" boot option used by Kali's
# forensic mode to avoid auto-mounting disks which are detected
# dynamically by udisks

# It is executed through /etc/xdg/autostart/kali-noautomount.desktop

# The downside of this approach is that the setting is overwritten every
# time that you login in the graphical interface. If you're fed up by this
# and want to keep automount always disabled, just edit this file and
# comment everything.
